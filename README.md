# dcm_npy_loader

Have a directory of Dicom images? Want them in a single NumPy array with their corresponding IDs? Use this fast solution. 

This tool only works for images in Dicom (.dcm) format and directly converts them to a NumPy array without a format such as JPEG in order to avoid image compression.
